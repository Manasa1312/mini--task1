    <h1>Hyderabad's Ramzan</h1>
    <b>📍 What happens</b>
    <p>During Ramzan, the area around Charminar in the Old City of Hyderabad comes alive with vibrant night-markets, lights, food stalls and a festive atmosphere.<br>
Streets like Laad Bazaar and the markets near Charminar stay open late — many shops extend hours until the early morning. <br>
Special foods dominate: traditional Ramzan dishes such as haleem, patthar ka gosht, dahi vada, sevaiyyan are common in the area.</p>
<b>🎉 Why it’s special</b>
<p>It’s not just a market or food event — it becomes a local cultural experience: the mix of heritage architecture (Charminar), old bazaars, street food and people from all communities together.<br>
The monument itself, Charminar, acts as both the landmark for the festival’s ambiance and the central hub for the activity.<br>
Visiting during Ramzan gives a different perspective of Hyderabad — more alive at night, full of scents, sounds and colours.</p>
