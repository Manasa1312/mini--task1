    <h1>Red Fort – Annual Independence Day Celebration</h1>
    <p><b>🏛️ What Happens at Red Fort</b>

The Prime Minister hoists the national flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort and delivers a nationally-broadcast address. <br>

A guard of honour, military march-past, and aerial displays (including flower-petals dropped from helicopters) are key features. <br>

Thousands of invited citizens — including students, veterans, community leaders — gather inside and around the Fort grounds. <br>

The ceremony symbolises India’s freedom, sovereignty, and the role of the Red Fort as a historic seat of power and culture.<br>

It also sets a tone for national goals and themes; for example, the 79th Independence Day at the Red Fort highlighted “Naya Bharat” (New India). <br>

The event reinforces unity, patriotism, and the diverse heritage of the country — with the fortified walls of the Red Fort forming a backdrop.</p>
