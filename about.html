    <p><I></I>India is a land of rich culture and heritage, known for its many historic monuments that tell stories of love, power, and faith. The Taj Mahal in Agra, built by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, stands as a symbol of eternal love. Every year, the Taj Mahotsav is celebrated near it to honor Indian art and tradition. The Red Fort in Delhi, built by Shah Jahan, became a symbol of India’s freedom when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru hoisted the national flag here on 15th August 1947. Since then, it is used for the annual Independence Day celebration. In the south, Hampi in Karnataka was once the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire, where King Krishnadevaraya was crowned in 1509. Today, the Hampi Utsav keeps that history alive through cultural programs. The Qutub Minar in Delhi, built by Qutb-ud-din Aibak in 1192, marked the beginning of Muslim rule in India, and now the Qutub Festival celebrates its architectural beauty with music and dance. Lastly, the Ajanta and Ellora Caves in Maharashtra, carved by Buddhist monks between the 2nd century BCE and 10th century CE, showcase India’s ancient art and spirituality. The Ajanta-Ellora Festival is held every year to celebrate this magnificent heritage. Together, these monuments remind us of India’s glorious past and cultural diversity.</p>

        <li> Charminar: Hyderabad, Telangana, India
Built in: 1591 CE
Built by: Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah
Architecture Style: Indo-Islamic with Persian influences

 Historic Significance:

The Charminar was built in 1591 to commemorate the end of a deadly plague that had affected Hyderabad.

It is believed that Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah prayed for the end of the plague and vowed to build a mosque at the site where he prayed — that became the Charminar.

The monument also marks the foundation of Hyderabad city.

The name Charminar means “Four Minarets,” referring to its four grand towers, each about 48.7 meters (160 ft) high.

It served as both a mosque and a center for trade and culture during the Qutb Shahi dynasty.
